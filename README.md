This is our presentation for UCSB's Department of Economics Data Hack.
My group won first place among five different groups who were trying to convince a panel of judges that there was a problem in California that lawmakers have been overlooking.
Our project was inspired by housing insecurity that all of us have faced while searching for housing in Isla Vista, the community in which the majority of UCSB students live.
It's no secret that UCSB students pay a lot of money for rent, and we were curious if other students at UC campuses had similar experiences.
Turns out, many UC campuses face similar problems where students are forced to pay unreasonable amounts for rent while living in condiitons that do not match the rent price.
In our analysis, our biggest talking point are our heatmaps, where we evaluate how rent prices have increased around UC campuses.
We start by taking the average rent index in 2015 for each different region.
California's tenant protection act tells us how much landlords are allowed to increase rent each year.
So we take the 2015 rent indices and apply the maximum allowed rent increase for each year up until 2025.
The value we get is the maximum allowed rent index for the 2025 given the value in 2015.
On the heatmaps, the lighter regions have indices that are closer to that maximum allowed rent index. 
This means that the rent prices in lighter regions increased more than rent prices in darker regions since 2015.
We found this pattern of ligher regions closer to the campus and darker regions further for the campus, which shows us the correlation between UC campuses and increased rent growth over the past 10 years.
